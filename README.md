### Questions
> 1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
    
>> I used a couple of external websites to help me do the additional work required for this project:

>>> -w3schools.org(for background image and text allignment)

>>> -geeks4geeks( to undertsand the basic stuffs like var and let difference)

>>> -rapidtables.com(for colors)

>>> -cssreference.io

>>> -google.com(for images)


> 2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

>> I faced a few challenges such as speeding up the intervals and giving the player 3 strikes. As I was doing the rproject, I kept on affecting the sound and color while trying to speed up the intervals. Another challenge but just minor challenge in speeding up the interval was deciding the exact
time for the intervals. At first I choose 100, but it became way too fast but then I reduced it down -25 the clueHoldTime after every interval. To allow the player 3 mistakes I first introduced a var called gameMistakes
which I initated it to 0 inside of gameStart(). What was challenging about this was where to put the gameMistake and how to implement it. At first I tried using while loop which check how many mistakes had been made. As I was
trying to put while loop, I figured an easier way which was to put gameMistakes variable at the end of guess function and put an if statement. The if statement checked if three mistakes had been made. If they had been 
made, it called the function gameLost().

> 3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission?  

>>I have a lot of questions about web development. I am used to of android development and havent really done web development that much using HTML,CSS or Javascript. I have used to wordpress and other websites 
to make websites before. I am extremely interested to know who different layouts, classes, packages are made in web development. Another thing I wanna know is can web development be changed into application on cellphones
without making the application all over again on a different platform like android studio or xcode. 

> 4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific.
>> If I had a few more hours I would add a lot of cool features. First of all I would add love to add animation in this project like the background moving and with each round, a different set of colors appear. I would
also increase the round and make the game more interesting and harder by introducing more colors after each round. Some thing I would love to do and I know it would be challenging is animation like the birds moving across 
the window. Also I would change the square boxes to something else like animals or whac-a-mole game
